The earthquake? It was terrible. I never expected that. I physically hurt from it, my heart hurts. Bricks were falling, it was scary. I ran to an open space. I still have dead bodies in my head. It was so scary. I couldn’t go to the office, so I just helped where I could. I am trained in basic first aid, so I helped to give first aid to people. I have done many search and rescue courses, basic first aid courses, but this was different.</p> <p>I cannot leave Red Cross. This is such impressive work. It all comes down to the seven principles, to the principle of humanity. I cannot go back.</p> <p>I am proud of this work. It’s good to say I’m working for humanity.</p> <p>Two or three hours after the earthquake, I decided I needed to do something so I walked to Bhaktapur. I saw all the roads were collapsed, security forces everywhere. I felt like I had some sort of power, and that my power is that I am Red Cross. I felt it.</p><p>After 15 or 16 days of working nonstop, it all caught up with me. I cried and cried and cried.</p>"

I have been doing registration at the health clinic for the past week. I lost both of my homes in the earthquakes. My father rented one closer to the market where our shop was and we had another one further in the mountains. After the first earthquake, we lost one. After the second earthquake, we lost the other. We lost our shop too, our source of income. The market is down now; there are not so many people anymore. It used to be lively.</p> <p>The Red Cross brought us food, some rice and dal, after the earthquake, and I learned about the health clinic. I asked for a job and now I register people when they come into the clinic. There are 27 villages around the health clinic that people are coming from. They travel between 4 and 11 hours to get here. Red Cross is well known so people know to go here for help.</p> <p>My family—my mother, father and younger brother—are now living in a tent until after monsoon season and then we will rebuild.</p>"

He draws it in crayon, sometimes in pen, but always the same thing. He is 12 years old and he lost his mother in the earthquake. He father left him, unable to cope. I’m not quite sure what it means yet, but his drawings really touch me. This is not a simple picture. I think he is trying to find ways to remember his mother. It is quite a traumatic experience for someone so young to go through.</p> <p>I also had a patient who was a 4 year old boy. He lost a third of his weight in less than a month. He had been buried in the rubble after the earthquake. His grandmother was concerned. He wouldn’t eat, even sweets. After seeing him a couple of times, he began to open up to others and started eating again.</p><p>His grandmother tried to tell me ‘thank you’ in Nepali. I couldn’t understand her words but in her eyes it was clear.</p> <p>I worked in Liberia before this. There are similarities to the situation people faced with Ebola. Both experiences are incredibly stressful.</p> <p>One thing I have heard both here and there, over and over is, ‘I don’t believe this is real’. One mother in Melamchi told me, ‘One moment I am feeding my child and 30 seconds later, he is dead in my arms.’ She goes feels the same trauma every morning when she wakes up.</p> <p>Without mental health services, you can give someone food but you can’t give them an appetite. You can give them shelter, but not a home. You can give them materials to rebuild their homes, but not to rebuild their lives. You can give them a blanket, but not sleep.</p>"

The training has taken me to Nepal and Sri Lanka. But the Nepal earthquake is my chance to put my skills into action.</p> <p>I feel pride as a Regional Disaster Response Team member. I’m grateful that the Red Cross Red Crescent used me in the Nepal operation. I can cope with this work. I can make a humanitarian contribution from the heart. I love the Red Cross Red Crescent because everyone works for the humanitarian impacts. And I love the seven fundamental principles and I honour them.</p> <p>I have been involved with distributing relief to people affected by the earthquakes, and water and sanitation activities.</p> <p>Coming from the same part of the world gives me a greater insight. I noticed some pregnant or breastfeeding women came to relief distributions with their ID cards but did not receive any help. They were not on the list of people entitled to aid.</p> <p>I feel for them. They’re vulnerable, really. If they’re vulnerable we should do something for them. I talked to my team leader about including them in the next round of distributions.</p> <p>My mother-in-law is afraid for me because Nepal is still prone to earthquakes but she encouraged me.</p> <p>My husband said, ‘If you feel it will be helpful for your profession, you can go. It’s up to you.’</p> <p>I said, ‘Don’t you worry that if an earthquake happened I could die?’</p> <p>He said, ‘If Allah has written your death to be in Nepal, you will die there’.</p> <p>If my family didn’t support me, I couldn’t be here.</p> <p>This is a sacrifice from the heart.

My sister and my aunt were both Red Cross volunteers and I was so impressed. I took a basic first aid training, all kinds of training. You have to have a will to be a volunteer, a will to help other people.</p> <p>There was a prediction of earthquakes in all my training, so I use to talk about earthquakes all the time. I always told people they needed to be prepared. I learned that when you’re a volunteer you can volunteer from the place you are, serving people around your home. That inspired me.</p> <p>After the earthquake, I thought I am alive, so I went to volunteer, handing out water and helping with first aid. My nephew and I walked for three hours that day, and I was still in my slippers. We dug people out of the rubble. I am also a nurse, so I helped where I could. The house just opposite of ours was destroyed. There was no network, no power, no phone, internet or electricity. We couldn’t find out about our family in Gorkha, we didn’t know if everyone was okay. I cried a lot that day.</p> <p>I went to check on my friend who lived near me. His apartment building was completely collapsed, eight floors. Two days before we had talked like we never had before, for nearly 1.5 hours. I tried to convince myself that he wasn’t home at the time of the earthquake. After Haiti, they found lots of people 3 or 4 days later. But they still haven’t found my friend’s body.</p> <p>When I went back to my family’s village in Gorkha, it looked like the beginning of time. No homes, just people. I slept in a goat shed. The heat was strong in the day and the rain was strong at night. We rotated positions so that not everyone had to sleep in the rain, but we all still got wet.</p><p>It was something out of my imagination. There was nothing there. Everything was gone. I couldn’t cry, I couldn’t laugh. Because this was happening everywhere.</p> <p>I use to live with my grandmother. We were very close. She died at 102 and had 17 children. She taught me to be confident. She was not educated but she was the most intellectual person I knew. She was my biggest inspiration. Red Cross is my second.</p><p>When I wear the Red Cross as a volunteer, I am proud. People treat you differently. I always people are thinking good things about me when they see I am a volunteer. </p>"

I have worked in Haiti, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, the Philippines and I was most recently in Liberia. Personally, it is impressive how much the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement is able to work in very different areas and contexts and still make such a good contribution to the people.</p> <p>People have a romantic view of Nepal, but it is very hard to work here. I am in Singati, a remote area in the Dolakha district and accessibility is very tricky here. The Nepal Red Cross Society and the Ministry of Health requested support for the operation here and in response we are running a basic health care unit. We see about 70 patients a day.</p>  <p>The day before I arrived, a woman who had suffered a miscarriage was brought in to the clinic. A rotation of family members carried her in a basket on their backs for 11 hours to get here.  And situations like this are common. It is unreal, just completely unreal.</p> <p>Nepal is very difficult logistics-wise. Because of the high mountains, it is difficult to get here, difficult for patients. They need a couple of hours to get here. Communications are difficult too, and it’s important to get information to the villages. We rely a lot on the Nepal Red Cross and the Ministry of Health. It’s a really important relationship to know the needs of our beneficiaries.</p> <p>The monsoon season has started so we have heavy rains and this causes challenges too. It’s breathtaking to see how people have gotten here, walking so far and carrying their family members on their backs. They are very appreciative because otherwise, they would have to go to Kathmandu, which is unreachable for many parts of the population. There are a lot of patients and it’s an ongoing challenge to see all of them.</p> "

I live in this house with seven other family members, my husband’s family and my 3 month old child.</p> <p>After the earthquakes, part of a wall collapsed and cracks appeared in other walls. So far we’ve covered up the cracks. We’re worried about the rain coming in but we haven’t had time to fix the wall yet. My father-in-law is a carpenter and builder so he’s part of a team helping our neighbours repair their houses. The house doesn’t feel safe.  Even now, we sleep on the veranda, afraid that an aftershock will bring the solid walls down on us. We tried to support the damaged wall with salvaged materials, but we plan to replace it with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting after the monsoon and before winter.</p> <p>We need to repair their toilet, which collapsed, and we’d also like to build a bigger house – so that we have room for family members who will return from working in Kathmandu and Dubai. We received a kitchen set—which also contained a pot and utensils – along with shelter materials and shelter tools – from the Nepal Red Cross Society.</p>  <p>So far we used the shelter tools to build a chicken coop.</p> "

Menstruation, for example, is something that, while a universal experience, needs to be specifically considered in a cultural context so that woman and their needs aren’t being left out of our response.</p> <p>I started by looking at what international standards say is important for women and girls and what other organisations do. Then I met with other departments to discuss items that had previously been supplied, drawing on the expertise of the water and sanitation and health departments, as well as communications so that we could create infographics explaining the contents.</p> <p>We also spoke with women and girls of different ages to check what their practice is – do some use reusable cloth? Do others use disposable? Is this the same or different across ages or based on wealth, for remote villages or in the city?</p> <p>Disposable pads cost 70 Nepalese rupees (about US$0.70) per month. This means every month women and girls must spend this money but for what? To just throw them away? It is much better to use soft cotton cloth – a half metre will last one woman an entire year for the same cost. We also gathered samples from our local market so that our kits are adapted to our women and girls actually use.</p> <p>This is important work and has a lot of impact on the access we have to women and vulnerable populations.</p> "

But in the rest of Nepal, people are moving on with whatever they can do to help with the disaster relief efforts. Tom and I drove through crumbled villages on the way to our field units and arrived at the same time as the Red Cross hospital and sanitation teams we are supporting. It was an eerie scene as we worked well into the night, with dozens of Red Crossers working by headlight.</p> <p>Literally overnight, a 60-bed hospital camp was well underway, and by the next afternoon they were accepting casualties and patients. As the scene unfolded around us, Tom and I worked to get our equipment up and running: satellite communications, wifi and internet-based phone service which were all desperately needed for the dozens of Red Cross workers to communicate and coordinate with the outside world.</p> <p>A Norwegian search and rescue team gifted us some equipment as they departed, so we even had a Red Cross laser printer and administrative supplies – trivial in civilization, but a major luxury for these field teams.
